1. Login to Get Tokens (access_token and refresh_token):

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "password": "SuperSecret123"
  }'

}

2. Access a Protected Route

curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/inventory/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVzaCI6ZmFsc2UsImlhdCI6MTY5OTk5OTk5OSwianRpIjoiYmQ0ZjU0ZDItZjZlNy00ZjQ1LThjNjItYmE3NjQ1YjUwMDAxIiwidHlwZSI6ImFjY2VzcyIsInN1YiI6MSwiZXhwIjoxNjk5OTk5OTk5LCJpYXQiOjE2OTk5OTk5OTl9.KaJyFbvL8qQ5Z6X1vL1vL1vL1vL1vL1vL1vL1vL1vL1"

3. Refresh the Access Token
When the access_token expires, use the refresh_token to get a new access_token:

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/refresh \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVzaCI6ZmFsc2UsImlhdCI6MTY5OTk5OTk5OSwianRpIjoiYmQ0ZjU0ZDItZjZlNy00ZjQ1LThjNjItYmE3NjQ1YjUwMDAxIiwidHlwZSI6InJlZnJlc2giLCJzdWIiOjEsImV4cCI6MTczMTUzNTk5OX0.2JyFbvL8qQ5Z6X1vL1vL1vL1vL1vL1vL1vL1vL1vL1"



Is It Good Enough?

For junior roles: Yes! This project demonstrates foundational skills in backend development, Docker, and databases.
For mid-level roles: Add a few of the improvements above (e.g., auth, testing, CI/CD) to make it stand out.
For full-stack roles: Pair it with a frontend or discuss how you’d integrate it with a frontend framework.

---
Your inventory management API project is a solid foundation for a portfolio,
especially for roles in backend development, DevOps, or full-stack development.
However, whether it’s "good enough" depends on your goals, the roles you’re
targeting, and how you present it.  Here’s a breakdown of its strengths, areas
for improvement, and how to showcase it effectively:
---

Strengths of Your Project
1. Technical Stack

Flask REST API: Demonstrates your ability to build a backend service.
Docker & Docker Compose: Shows you can containerize applications and manage multi-container setups.
MariaDB/MySQL: Proves you can work with relational databases.
SQL Scripts & Schema Design: Highlights your understanding of database design and relationships.
Testing: Includes basic pytest setup, which is a plus.
Documentation: README and API endpoint table are clear and professional.

2. Project Structure

Modular design (app/routes, app/models, app/schemas).
Separation of concerns (routes, models, config).
Use of environment variables for configuration.

3. DevOps & Deployment

Dockerized setup with persistent storage.
Easy to run locally with docker compose up.
Includes phpMyAdmin for database management.


Areas for Improvement
1. Features & Functionality

Authentication/Authorization: Add JWT or OAuth2 for secure endpoints.
Advanced Queries: Implement complex queries (e.g., inventory reports, filtering, sorting).
Soft Deletes: Use is_deleted flags instead of hard deletes.
Pagination: Add pagination for large datasets.
Validation: Use a library like Pydantic or Marshmallow for request/response validation.

2. Testing

Expand test coverage (e.g., test all CRUD operations, edge cases).
Add integration tests for API endpoints.
Use a testing database (e.g., SQLite for tests, MySQL for production).

3. CI/CD Pipeline

Add a GitHub Actions or GitLab CI workflow for automated testing and deployment.
Include linting (e.g., flake8, black) and code formatting.

4. API Documentation

Use Swagger/OpenAPI (e.g., flask-swagger-ui) for interactive API docs.
Add example requests/responses in your README.

5. Frontend (Optional)

If targeting full-stack roles, add a simple frontend (React, Vue, or even HTML/JS) to interact with the API.

6. Error Handling

Improve error messages and HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 for not found, 400 for bad requests).
Log errors for debugging.

7. Performance

Add caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data.
Optimize database queries (e.g., avoid N+1 queries).

8. Security

Use environment variables for secrets (e.g., python-dotenv).
Sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection.

9. Scalability

Discuss how you’d scale the project (e.g., load balancing, database replication).


How to Showcase It in Your Portfolio
1. GitHub Repository

Clean up the repo:

Remove unnecessary files (e.g., __pycache__, .pyc).
Add a .gitignore file (you already have one, which is great!).
Include a live demo link (e.g., deploy to Render, Railway, or AWS).


Write a detailed README:

Project overview and goals.
Features and technologies used.
Setup instructions (with Docker and without).
Example API requests (using curl or Postman).
Screenshots of the API in action (e.g., phpMyAdmin, Postman).



2. Live Demo

Deploy the project to a cloud provider (e.g., Render, Heroku, AWS ECS).
Include a link in your portfolio and README.

3. Blog Post or Case Study

Write a short blog post or LinkedIn article explaining:

Why you built this project.
Challenges you faced and how you solved them.
What you learned.



4. Portfolio Website

Add the project to your portfolio with:

A brief description.
Key features.
Technologies used.
Links to the GitHub repo and live demo.



5. Highlight Your Role

If this is a solo project, emphasize your end-to-end ownership.
If it’s part of a larger project, explain your contributions.


Is It Good Enough?

For junior roles: Yes! This project demonstrates foundational skills in backend development, Docker, and databases.
For mid-level roles: Add a few of the improvements above (e.g., auth, testing, CI/CD) to make it stand out.
For full-stack roles: Pair it with a frontend or discuss how you’d integrate it with a frontend framework.


Final Verdict
Your project is portfolio-ready as is, but adding even 1-2 of the improvements above (e.g., authentication, Swagger docs, or CI/CD) will make it much stronger. Focus on how you present it—a well-documented, easy-to-run project with clear value will impress employers.
